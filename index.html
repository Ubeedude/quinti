    <h1>QUINTILLIOUS SLOGANOG</h1>
    <p>Quintillious was born/raised as an ultimate war machine in a lab in south northern russia, near chernobyl. He was created from the remains of the most powerful warrior fandel finglebottom (鯖鮺鮺鯃),, All that remained of the warrior was his head, Adam's apple, and a single nerve from where his head was cut off. They fed quintillious with pure uranium rods, Soon, He grew to strong. He craved stronger food. He broke into a nearby uranium plant. When they caught him, It was too late. Quintillious had fed off everything that had radiation in it. He had caused nuclear fallout. Millions upon millions died or were injured. He traveled around the nuclear winter landscape feeding upon the corpses. Growing stronger every day due to the radiated ash rain. One day he saw a helicopter. He quickly hid under a mountain lion's corpse. An entire platoon of men in hazmat suits poured out, They opened up their flamethrowers and started to decontaminate the area, Quintillious saw the helicopter as an opportunity to escape the wasteland, He snuck into the gas tank and waited. Waited to conquer the new lands he would find..

    <p>	Quintillious is a being, a supernatural existing entity. He was alive before time was even a thing, waiting for the perfect moment. Fast forward a couple of eons  Quintillious, we will proceed to call “him” entity, is set in California and is doing said “stuff”. We will start to describe the entity. The entity is not really a “he” or a “she”, but we will refer to him as a he in the further lore. Entity is described as to be as tall as 10ft, with a long skinny neck. He has no real body, but has an adams apple instead. His ONE weakness is his exposed nerve, which dangles from his Adam's apple like a loose piece of string. His face is the definition of food deprived, the entity has absolutely no face fat. The mouth does not even exist, it curls into a deranged, very frightening grimace at all times. Entity’s eyes are cold and dark, if you could even look him in the eye, you would lose all nutrients being sucked into the abyss. To explain more of his body feature would be torture, and could kill a human being in seconds. His own existence is to kill, leading on into his early life

    <p>Quintillious started as just a head, As stated in the “Early life” Article. But when he entered the gas tank he…. Evolved. He grew extremely long, bony arms with razor sharp claws, He grew unholy long legs for charging at his victims, His mouth ripped open to reveal thousands upon thousands of razor sharp teeth, He was easily over 16 feet tall, Towering over everyone, and yet his hands still dragged on the floor. The chopper he stowed away inside landed in a military base in southern california to refuel, when the poor refueler reached to put the fuel in, The skeletal arm shot out and tore him to shreds. Quintillious rushed out, feeding on the scraps of the dead. He ripped all of the task force who tried to kill him in half, Tore out the site director’s jugular and ran into the desert. Because quintillious had no radiation to feed on. He grew weaker. His arms shrunk into nothing, Legs fell off, He was back to his original state. He barely survived, Feeding of the gamma radiation rays from the sun. </p>

    <p>He was found in Redlands, California, waiting for his victims to approach. The entity needed to consume once every decade, so when it came time he was deprived and would do anything to get his next meal. He craved for the juicy, appetizing taste of meat, his mouth not, mouth, watered with satisfaction as he zoomed in on his targets. His targets that we speak of were some men loitering around the nearest Walmart. One weakness of the entity is that it cannot be spotted or it will go into immense pain and start to fade. It will be difficult to capture his prey if he gets spotted. First, the entity would lure its selected into an empty area, usually his area of choice, the backrooms. Well the backrooms are a complicated whole dimension itself, at first glance it looks like a normal building, but empty and very docile, but as you go on it becomes bigger and larger. This is the perfect region for Quintillious to lure and eliminate his selection of meat. Back to the present, he was looking at his choice with malicious intent. The entity then proceeded to lure all of his 7 targets to the no clip sector. They fell through the portal into the backrooms and were devoured in shocking ways that I couldn’t even describe. The entity has now gotten his meal. What will he do for the next decade? Fate decides that, he might cause another world war, or he might cause his 5th mass genocide, Because he can. His eye needed a clean every now and then, so he looked people causing them to become a deranged unstable person who can do anything any second (and die)</p>
