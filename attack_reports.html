    <h3>Attack reports.
        Quintillious has strange attack patterns, He could attack victims in a dark alleyway, Or in the plain day of a public place. Some reports have been out of the news, A woman was driving on the 65 highway, And her car hit a bump, She pulled over and checked it out, She saw nothing but a small hole in the bottom of the car, She climbed back inside to try to start up the car, But the engine stalled. She made the mistake of opening the hood. Quintillious Jumped out and started to bite the woman. She would have died if a trucker would not have seen this and tried to shoot Quintillious, Quintillious ran off into the woods. Next report is a police sighting, Quintillious went on a massacre in a motel. The police thought it was a little suspicious that no one from the motel was going outside, So they went in. They saw blood smeared over the walls, bloody handprints all over the windows, the innkeeper was slumped over the desk, heart ripped out. The two sheriffs were stunned with fear, One pressed on by himself. The last mistake he’d ever make. The brave, but stubborn sheriff went into a room, It seemed peaceful, No bodies. He went into the bathroom, Two children lay dead. One drowned in the toilet, Blood all over his body, The other one… Quintillious was feeding on. The sheriff cocked his revolver and shot at him, Quintillious screeched and ran into the vents, He kept shooting then. *Click* Cick*. He had run out of ammo, Quintillious knew he had won. He leapt onto the sheriff's head and tore his frontal lobe out. The other sheriff heard the screams and rushed up, The sheriff watched in horror as Quintillious ate his partner, He picked up his walkie and yelled for backup, quintillious rushed at him, He barely had time to get out of the room, Quintillious grabbed his leg and dragged him back, the backup arrived and saved the sheriff, Quintillious escaped through the sewers. The sheriff is now in a mental asylum, The mere sighting of the entity flayed his mind to nothing.
        
        2018/9/4, 9 missing children, 1 day, 1 child 9 children reported missing in the span of a day. Could be a major kidnapping, or could be there just lost, who knows? This very much a CLASSIFIED document will state in depth what happened, how it happened and why it happened. We have connected this case to the very many disappearances that happen every decade at exactly 9/4 9:00 am. These missing people cases have stumped both the police forces and the FBI together. They beleive that an unknown entity is snatching and murdering the victims with such revolting violence, there is no such body remains. These murdererings have resulted in the death of over 500 people in the time frame of 5 decades. Generation after generation of law enforcement agencies have failed to locate the killer. All we know is that the unknown being is at least 10ft tall and is not part of the human race. We have deployed Agent M. and Agent E. to investigate and hopefully find the creature that lurks. UPDATE: A few days after the murder, “it” went on another killing spree, killing 70 people at the national muesum of historics, including the two Agents. We have made a public announcement to try to cover up the whole story, but CNN and other large news companies have somehow gotten inside information. According to them, they say that a supernatural being is upon us and that we need to shelter. As we all know, this isn't a big deal as everyone is making it and that “it” will stop committing mass genocide.

        2019/9/4 the bathroom massacre - 506 victims
        This is an unexplainable task. How can one wipe out 506 people in a matter of minutes? We are now working with several out of country intelligence agencies to help find this threat. Every year the numbers pile up. September fourth. What is so important about that date? Every decade for the last couple of million years has had a mass killing on that specific date. For HUNDREDS of years we have tried to track down the thing. We have suspected some type of alien or something like that. The CIA and MI6 are doing their work to track down the entity. Its been years and years, but we've finally found a lead. The cult.

        1968/8/6 The meltdown - [UNKNOWN] Victims.
        This is one of my most dark cases. The meltdown was a horrifying “Accident’. Back in 1968. To think that all that time and it’s still not solved? Anyway, A top secret lab in Hawaii was attacked, Even i didn’t have clearance to witness the full attack. From the footage I saw I could see the scientists working on.. Something… When I asked what it was, the agent just stared at me.. Anyway,  Next thing I know the nearest scientist dropped dead. Something was blurring around the room, Killing everything. It broke into what I guessed was a Bio station the scientists were working on and started.. Eating the things inside. One soldier walked in the room. I had to turn away from the footage as the creature leapt at him and blood and bits of flesh spattered the camera. The screams were horrifying. All of the cameras one by one shut off. Finally the thing made it to the reactor. It seemed to be drinking the coolant. Causing nuclear meltdown. An uncountable amount of lives were lost in that “Incident.”.

        2003/6/4 The foundation site killings - 130 Victims.
        A top secret foundation in the rocky mountains was attacked by what few witnesses say was a Shadow. I told them that a shadow couldn't attack. It was a mere shadow. But they insisted. Their eyes glanced at the shadows in the room. As if waiting for something to happen. The foundation was inside of a mountain. A top secret containment for anomalous entities. They had just captured a new creature. They found it in california. A simple floating head. But they knew it was Much. Much. More. They had just about locked it in the cage when the alarms sounded. They panicked. Has something escaped? Calling all units! We are being attacked! The security guards rushed past and to their horror saw the human prisoners being dragged into… Shadows. Black blotches of darkness on the floor. Skeletal hands were reaching blindly through dragging everything through. One grabbed a security guard. He screamed and clawed at the floor as he was dragged into the darkness. After a white the screams stopped. A single arm shredded and half eaten flew out. The officer ordered to fire, The foolish guards opened fire on the shadows. There was a deafening scream. The arms sank back into the darkness. They thought they were safe. Creatures shot out of the shadows in the corners of the room. They were Shadow walkers As stated in the void section on flora and fauna in the realms. They grabbed the officer's arm and legs and ripped him apart. That incident left the entire facility destroyed.. All anomalous creatures escaped.

        1980/5/5 classified - classified Victims.
        A while ago, located in classified, the entity consumed all. It was gruesome and terrifying. We were working at a classified lab. It was an experience like no other. We were testing the human limits, with humans. The amalgamations we managed to make were horrendous. A poor man with arms coming out of his eyes, a girl who had an uncountable amount of heads, the things we saw. One night I was stationed at sunrise. I was exhausted and couldn't think properly, I was in the process of rearranging the DNA and limbs of the patient when I made a mistake. A mistake that would hurt the rest of humanity for all of time. I made it. Crocus I called it, the name of my old street I used to live on. He had punctured eyeballs that were half in, his limbs were spewing blood, but he didn't die, his legs were mushy and cracked each time he walked. What happened next wiped out all the information we did. Crocus wiped out the whole building of employees, he spared the victims of experience. They are roaming around classified to this day, rearranged limbs and half dead. Crocus roams around somewhere hiding, we've been looking for him. We know he's out here waiting. - The ramblings of a crazy man we apprehended the other day, he passed away due to suicide the other day, gone insane from his thoughts.

        2000/3/4 The chicago cleansing - 1050 “Accidental” Victims.
        The entity has escaped to chicago. We sent a heavily armed unit to go sweep the area for it. I had no idea why they would do this. After they got to the city they stationed a quarantine. Everyone had to stay inside for three weeks. There were several Sightings Of the creature in buildings so the unit burned down the buildings. 54 dead, 22 injured. There was a protest in the square to stop the quarantine. The unit said they saw the entity so they fired a drone strike on the square. Hundreds of people died.

        2023/2/2 - Lab Assasination - 3 victims
        
        I was working for a lab in southern california, They were working on a top secret project called R.A.D.P.A.D. I don't know what it was for but it was super important. The manager of the project called all the top executives to the headquarters to have a meeting. That's when it happened. I was a janitor cleaning the bathrooms when I heard a deafening howl. Then came the screams, Abruptly, The screams ceased. I peeked out and something scampered out of the room past the hallway. I ran inside the room to see all 3 of the meeting people dead. Bleeding from the ears.
